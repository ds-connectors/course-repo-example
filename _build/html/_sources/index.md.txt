## Description

CS 88 is a connector for Data 8 that is designed for students who would like a more complete introduction to Computer Science. We will cover a variety of topics such as functional programming, data abstraction, object-oriented programming, and program complexity. This course will be taught primarily in Python. However, we are interested in teaching you foundational programming ideas, not just how to use one particular programming language. Once you have learned the essence of programming and the concepts that appear in various forms in programming languages, you will be able to pick up other languages and other programming concepts rapidly. 
You must be currently enrolled in or have taken Data 8. There is no formal programming-related prerequisite for CS 88. You do not need to be familiar with any particular programming language.

The material for this course has significant overlap with CS 61A. We do not cover the interpretation section of CS61A. If you are certain that you want to major or minor in Computer Science, CS 61A is the right introductory course. You can take CS 61A for credit after having taken CS 88. However, you cannot take CS 88 for credit after having taken CS 61A. Data 8 and CS 88 together satisfy the knowledge prerequisite for CS 61B.

## Grading

Your course grade is computed using a point system with a total of 230 points, with the following distribution.

* Midterm: 20%
* Final: 20%
* Projects: 30%
* Weekly Homework: 20%
* Weekly Labs: 10%
* EPA (Effort, Participation, Altruism)

The EPA points will be determined at the end of the semester and will only serve to boost your grade.

## Late Policy

You will have 2 slip days that you can use for any assignments (homework, labs, projects). These must be used as days and cannot be broken down into smaller units, such as hours or minutes. To use a slip day, please submit a request here. Using slip days will essentially extend the due date for a given assignment by the number of slip days you want to use. For homework and labs, there is no credit for late submissions. For projects, 2 points will be deducted for each day the project is late.
