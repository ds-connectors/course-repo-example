# Sample Course Repository

This repository is one example of how you may want to structure your course repository. Below are some key features of this structure.

## Repository Structure 

1. All content is on the `gh-pages` branch. 
    * By putting content on the `gh-pages` branch (as opposed to the `master`) branch, GitHub will automatically create a site for your 
    repository. You can view the site for this repo at 
    [https://gunjanbaid.github.io/course-repo-example](https://gunjanbaid.github.io/course-repo-example).
    * All markdown (`.md`) files that have a heading (lines starting with hashes) will be published.
    * Markdown files without headings will not be published.

1. Separate folders for each semester
    * This allows you to save content from each semester.
    * Clean URL structure for course sites. For example: [https://gunjanbaid.github.io/course-repo-example/fa17](https://gunjanbaid.github.io/course-repo-example/sp18) 
    and [https://gunjanbaid.github.io/course-repo-example/sp18](https://gunjanbaid.github.io/course-repo-example/sp18).
    
1. Separate folders for `hw`, `labs`, `lec`, `proj` in each semester's folder.

1. Separate `index.md` files in each semester's folder.
    * There is an `index.md` file in the [`fa17` folder](https://github.com/gunjanbaid/course-repo-example/tree/master/fa17) and 
    in the [`sp18` folder](https://github.com/gunjanbaid/course-repo-example/tree/master/sp18). 
    * The `index.md` file in the [root directory](https://github.com/gunjanbaid/course-repo-example/tree/master) redirects to the
    `index.md` file for the current semester. Currently, it redirects to `fa17`. Thus, if you go to 
    [https://gunjanbaid.github.io/course-repo-example](https://gunjanbaid.github.io/course-repo-example), you will be redirected to 
    [https://gunjanbaid.github.io/course-repo-example/fa17](https://gunjanbaid.github.io/course-repo-example).
